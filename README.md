Tavenem.Universe
==

Tavenem.Universe provides classes to help model an entire universe, from the largest cosmological
structures down to the atomic scale (not all at once, of course).

## Installation

Tavenem.Universe is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tavenem.Universe/).

## Roadmap

Tavenem.Universe is currently in a **prerelease** state. Development is ongoing, and breaking
changes are possible before the first production release.

No release date is currently set for v1.0 of Tavenem.Universe. The project is currently in a "wait
and see" phase while [Tavenem.DataStore](https://github.com/Tavenem/DataStore) (a dependency of
Tavenem.Universe) is in prerelease. When that project has a stable release, a production release of
Tavenem.Universe will follow.
